# Nocturne save files
## How to use
- Open the folder corresponding to the point in the game you're interested in,
- Open the folder located in "[disk]:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\SEGA\smt3hd\[numbers]" on your computer,
- Replace its file called "SMT3HDDATA.sav",
- Open "Notes.txt" to know which save file to load after launching the game.
## Notes
- All save files come from a modded playthrough so they may contain unused items or illogical demon builds,
- Fiends (besides Matador) and specific progressions of the Labyrinth of Amala may be hard to find since they aren't bound by the progression of the main story,
- Demi-fiend has a magic build for most of the game so only the right door can be opened in the third Kalpa.
